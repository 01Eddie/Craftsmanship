# Known Katas :

## RentalMovie
This one is a dense set of bad smells design in a book talking about refactoring
@see Martin Fowler and/or Refactoring to patterns

## Trip Service
A travel social agency design by Sandro Mancuso.
It is about cutting dependencies when they are singleton and/or static.
You meet these dependencies when covering code with tests and code is quite small.
So hitting those two points come quite fast and allow you try easily try several means.

# Katas to add :

## Gilded Rose
It is a forest of 'if' and 'else' and a paradise for refactoring tools.
I think about using 'quick fixes' (Ctrl+1) in eclipse and 'intentions and quick fixes' (Alt+Enter) in IntelliJ every where (with carret on if, keyword, else, &&, ||, on constructor argument, on variables, on method arguments, ...).
The part o covering ti with test is tedious, but worth it !

## Trivia
Heard good about it, I must try it !
