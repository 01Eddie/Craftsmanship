# What to expect from each Kata.

As a good consultant, I may tell you it depends !
Actually, many correct and good implementations can be done for each Katas.
So results does vary widely.

Most Kata where done to allow discovery and learning.
You can always expect few features only to implement and they will still make you think.
The aim is not in solving kata's need, but to slow down and learn on how you solve it and doing it perfectly according to your own taste.

Above facts means that even if I expect things to happen with a kata, it may not happen to every one.
So category will only be about :
   * Where do I Begin ? the answer being by the introduction !
   * Green fields Kata (aka TDD) : simple features without stack or existing code as constraint so you can implement them they way you want.
   * Brown fields Kata (aka Refactoring) : simple features also but with an existing code base that will constrain you as you may encounter in real projects.

## Introduction
Introduction contains well known Katas used as first exercises to make a contact with some new practices or to demo them in live coding.
Another way to put it, they are the shortest useful exercises, I know.

## raw-sources
It contains local copies of exercises took from public and freely accessible sources.
Content that may be copyrighted and publicly accessible is here as a backup for personal use.

## Test Driven Development
The TDD directory contains green field Katas.

## Refactoring
The Refactoring directory contains brownfield katas that aim at testing, refactoring and cleaning existing code.
