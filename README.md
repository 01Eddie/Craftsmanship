# Craftsmanship

Craftsmanship is about being professional.
As a professional in software development, I find I missed some skills to be a complete programmer.
Building easily maintanable software in the long run is the most unkown skill.
There is a consensus in our craftsmanship community about how to fulfill this missing skill.

## It's all about XP, Clean Code, TDD and Refactoring Legacy Code.

My value or concern is about building long term profitable software.
It find its principles or recipes in 'XP explained', 'TDD by example', 'Clean Code', 'Working Effectively with Legacy software'.
I found practices to do at home on katas, and if they work on real business and testing code.
Many other recipes can be found in other books as 'refactoring to design patterns', 'Growing object oriented software with tests', etc...

Here, I lists all exercises that I found useful to me or that I plan to use for myself in a near future.

## it is based on Katas and Dojos'exercises

Katas are exercises with few functionality (I didn't said easy).
They shall take one or a few hours to both solve and explore.
Dojos are exercises that goes beyond a Kata.
Usually, after a kata like work, you will have a last requirement that will be challenging your mind.

Each exercises has been created by someone who I am thankful for.
