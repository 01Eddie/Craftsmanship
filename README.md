# Craftsmanship

Here is the place where I craft code, learn practices by solving exercise I keep here.
My solution won't stay here except to discuss them with peers around and will disapear after without notice.

Katas are exercises without surprises nor tough algorythms. they shall take one or a few hours to both solve and explore.
Dojos are exrecises that goes beyond a Kata. Usualy, after a kata like work, you will have a last requirement that will be challenging your mind.

All thoses exercises come from peers and were found on the world wild web.
Even if I try to provide my sources, I may find them a site that reuse an exercise. Worse, some are so well known that they appear on many repos/website/whatever.
Do not hesitate to claim owner ship for you or for any other that may be the real author.
